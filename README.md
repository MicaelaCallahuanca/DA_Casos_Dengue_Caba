## Context

Dengue surveillance in Argentina is carried out by seasons that range from EW 31 of one year to EW 30 of the following year. It usually starts in summer and ends in autumn. Until now, all seasons have been characterized by the cessation of dengue activity throughout the national territory before EW 30. However, in recent epidemic years an increase in the magnitude of the event could be observed (greater number of cases). , greater territorial dispersion, recording recurrence of outbreaks in localities traditionally associated with dengue outbreaks, as well as the emergence of the disease in localities that did not have a history of previous outbreaks.

## Project description

A data analyst role will be performed where Buenos Aires Data data will be used to see the numbers of cases that occur in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.
 The data was extracted from [Buenos Aires Data](https://data.buenosaires.gob.ar/dataset/reporte-epidemiologico-de-dengue).
 

- The cases will be analyzed depending on the communes.
- as a KPI we look at whether green zones helped contribute to the increases in cases in the area by comparing the quarters.
